# climatic_variability

Investigating how climatic variability influences insect pest populations on three continents

This is an on going project that I am currently collecting data for. The project goals are to demonstrate how seasonal climatic variable influence the population dynamics of Helicoverpa species in North America, South America, and Australia.

Data is currently confidential and this will likely be the case when this is published as a manuscript.

More details to come once this project is developed more.
